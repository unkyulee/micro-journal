## Micro Journal Rev.6: Vivian in New York

I'm deep in the throes of this iteration, and it's a special one. A playwright needed a sleek, stylish, and compact writing device that could be used in cafes and parks. It had to have a handle for easy carrying and a protective cover to keep it safe in the bag.

Enter the Micro Journal Rev.6, now with Cherry MX hot-swappable sockets, letting users customize their mechanical keyboard setup. It features a 48-key ortholinear layout, with a custom configuration via SD card (still in the works). The leather strap makes it easy to carry, and the display protective case doubles as a hood for privacy while writing on the go.

I'm having some feelings that might be akin to love. I'm trying to deny this affection for an object, but I can't ignore the joy and lightness I feel when holding the leather strap.
