### In case of repair request

In case if your unit needs a repair, I can have a look and fix it and ship it back. In worst case, I can build a new one and ship it back to you. Provided that you send me the unit and cover the shipping cost and the material cost (if necessary). Typically shipping costs for me to ship it back takes around 55 USD. Send me a message when you are in need of a repair.




### Disclaimer

I want to be clear so there is no misunderstanding. I design these writer decks for myself in my own search for the perfect writing and journaling device. I design the devices, print them, purchase and assemble the electronics and write the software. I share these designs and the software and provide parts in a kit for those who want such a device as a DIY (Do It Yourself) project. I also assemble these devices if people want, in which case you are also paying for my time, but they are still DIY. If problems occur, solutions may involve your tinkering under the hood. I enjoy sharing my designs and delight in people finding them useful. But I am not a manufacturer, I am hand crafting devices. There is no warranty and although I will try to help out when people run into problems, you are not purchasing any obligation for customer support. I have a job and a family, I take vacations, I have no staff that mans the phones or responds to emails while I am away. If you are not comfortable with my limits, then you may want consider some other mass manufactured device. I will always try to help, but within reasonable limits.
