# Micro Journal Rev.4: Captain Hook

What makes a good keyboard for a writer? Micro Journal Rev.4 is a computer keyboard, but it's designed with writers in mind. People who craft words carefully, arrange them professionally, and need a tool that adapts to their workflow. Here's what I focused on to make this keyboard truly unique and indispensable.

**Specialized keys for writers.** Sometimes the smallest details matter. Em dashes, accented letters like é, copyright symbols ©, open and close smart quotes, ellipses … All these tiny characters make a big difference in polished writing. Rev.4 gives you easy access to them without breaking your flow.

**Customizable key behavior.** Every writer works differently. Caps Lock might be useless for one person but essential for another. In Rev.4, you get full control over what each key does. Swap functions, assign macros, or replace rarely used keys with your favorite shortcuts. It's your keyboard, your rules.

**Capture instant thoughts.** Inspiration doesn't wait. The moment an idea sparks, you want to jot it down immediately. With Rev.4, switching from normal keyboard to writerDeck is fast and intuitive. That fleeting sentence or sudden insight is never lost. You can capture it right in front of your screen.

**Typing should feel good.** Writing is physical as well as mental. The feel of each keystroke matters. Rev.4 uses mechanical switches and carefully considered ergonomics so that typing is not just functional, but pleasurable. Long writing sessions become less fatiguing and more immersive.

Rev.4 was designed as a bridge between everyday work and spontaneous writing. At its core, it functions as a regular mechanical keyboard for your computer, but with a flick of a switch, it instantly transforms into a standalone writerDeck. This makes it perfect for those moments when inspiration strikes while you're at your desk. Instead of reaching for a notebook or hunting for another device, you can capture thoughts and ideas right away, without breaking your flow.

### In case of repair request

In case if your unit needs a repair, I can have a look and fix it and ship it back. In worst case, I can build a new one and ship it back to you. Provided that you send me the unit and cover the shipping cost and the material cost (if necessary). Typically shipping costs for me to ship it back takes around 48 USD. Send me a message when you are in need of a repair.




### Disclaimer

I want to be clear so there is no misunderstanding. I design these writer decks for myself in my own search for the perfect writing and journaling device. I design the devices, print them, purchase and assemble the electronics and write the software. I share these designs and the software and provide parts in a kit for those who want such a device as a DIY (Do It Yourself) project. I also assemble these devices if people want, in which case you are also paying for my time, but they are still DIY. If problems occur, solutions may involve your tinkering under the hood. I enjoy sharing my designs and delight in people finding them useful. But I am not a manufacturer, I am hand crafting devices. There is no warranty and although I will try to help out when people run into problems, you are not purchasing any obligation for customer support. I have a job and a family, I take vacations, I have no staff that mans the phones or responds to emails while I am away. If you are not comfortable with my limits, then you may want consider some other mass manufactured device. I will always try to help, but within reasonable limits.
