# Quick Start Guide – Micro Journal Rev.4

When you receive your **Micro Journal Rev.4**, you'll need just a few things to get started.
The device works right away with a USB-C cable, but you can also install three AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries for portable use.

If you don't want to read everything, here's the one (or two) thing to remember:
* **Click the knob once to switch between Keyboard mode and writerDeck mode.**
* **Press and hold (1 second) to open the Menu.**
* You should be able to get into any of the filespaces by holding Alt and pressing the number keys 1-0 in writerDeck mode.

## User Interface

* **Knob actions**

  * Rotate → navigate or adjust options.
  * Click once → toggle between **Keyboard mode** and **writerDeck mode**.
  * Long press (1 second) → open the **Menu** for extra operations.

* **Power behavior**

  * Connected via USB-C → the device is powered on.
  * **Power switch OFF** → battery is disconnected. The device will only run when USB-C is plugged in, and the battery will not charge.

## Installing the Battery

1. Use a **TORX T10H screwdriver** to remove the four M3 screws on the top-left panel (where the power switch is located).
2. Gently lift the panel.
3. Insert three AAA rechargeable NiMH batteries into the holder.
4. Close the panel and screw it back on.

```
The Rev 4 uses three *rechargeable* AAA Ni-MH batteries. Do not use non-rechargeable AAA batteries. They are placed in the Rev 4 by removing the four Torx T10H screws around the power switch and then easing the power switch panel out. The battery holder is on the bottom, set a little back. Place the batteries in the holders (the bottom of the batteries are always against the spring), Then replace the panel and screws, It is a good idea to have already charged the batteries externally before installing as they may otherwise take a while to charge.
