## Introducing the Micro Journal Rev 4

The Rev 4 is unique among the Micro Journals developed by Un Kyu Lee. The other Micro Journals are first and foremost Writer Decks with excellent keyboards (or, in the case of the Rev 5, with the ability to use excellent keyboards). They have connectivity options allowing them to be used as keyboards for your computer, but that isn't their primary focus and design consideration.

The Rev 4 is first and foremost an excellent computer keyboard with a writerDeck capability built in. Hopefully, this user guide will make the difference between those two descriptions clear.

Whenever you see the description "excellent keyboard," it should be understood that what is meant is "excellent keyboards for writers." The Rev 4 makes a great computer keyboard for many things. But the focus here is on how useful it is for writers, for people producing words and editing those words. The author of this guide has used the Rev 4 exclusively as his computer keyboard for many weeks and has no desire to return to his formerly favorite computer mechanical keyboard.

## Using the Micro Journal Rev 4 - A Walkthrough

### Setting Up the Micro Journal Rev 4

The Rev 4 is actually the easiest Micro Journal to set up, Simply use a USB cable to connect the Rev 4 to your computer as you would any keyboard. When you do, the keyboard will be powered by it's connection to the computer. It should work for typing on your computer right away. No special drivers or settings are needed.

The Rev 4 is a 75% ISO mechanical keyboard that is about the same width as the Alphasmart Neo 2. It is writing focused in that it doesn't have media keys, a Numpad (although there is a method get Alt-Numpad generated special ASCII characters), or exposed F-Keys (They are available on a separate layer). You are welcome to change either the key caps and/or the switches as you see fit. Above the keyboard you have, on the left, the power switch. It is actually only a power switch for the batteries, which are optional, so this guide will not talk about the power switch until *Scenario 3*. Above the keyboard, in the center, is an LCD display that has an animated gif (small animation) on it until you do something that requires the screen. Finally, on the left is a large dial.

You will be guided through three scenarios so that you can see more clearly what you can do with the Rev 4, and why it is unique. The scenarios will use the Rev 4 in the default state as it is when you first get it. There are ways to modify the Rev 4, especially the keyboard and the key maps. This is a more technical topic so the Key Maps will be saved for the end of this guide. The three scenarios here will allow running through all of the Rev 4's capabilities and menu items.

### Scenario 1: Using the Rev 4 As Your Computer Keyboard - One Click Access to writerDeck mode

As said above, The Rev 4 connects to your computer via USB cable and your new computer keyboard is ready to go. But here is what is special about it. This is the focus of this scenario. Suppose you are working on something which isn't your writing. And suppose, while working on that non-writing-related something else an idea pops into your head. An important idea about what you are going to be writing later. Ideas, especially ones that are important, can be fleeting and fragile. As soon as this idea hits you click the dial on the right once. A quick click - don't hold it down. You suddenly see a second animation on the small LCD display and then you see (assuming this is the first time) a mostly blank screen. Two things just happened when you made that one quick click. One, you were dropped into the editor for the Rev 4 writerDeck. Two, the Rev 4 no longer sends key strokes to your computer. You are forced to focus down onto a small typing screen. This is what is referred to as *writerDeck mode*.

All of this happens in an instant, and that's the key. That fragile story idea that came out of nowhere - one click and start typing to capture it. Or maybe something just happened that you want to immediately capture in a journal. Or maybe something as trivial as a phone number, to-do list item or appointment you want to be sure you can find later without having to dig up your calendar, to-do or contacts program. Click and type.

The screen is 80 pixels high and 160 pixels wide. When you are in the editor for the first time, most of the screen is blank, At the top right corner is a number from 0 to 9 that tells you which of the ten filespaces you are using. You don't name and save files. The words you type are saved every time there is a brief pause in typing. They are saved in files 0.txt, 1.txt, 2.txt, etc., depending on which filespace you are typing in. Below that number is a vertical line running the length of the right hand border of the LCD display. That line is green before you start typing. When you type, the line on the display turns red, meaning there is unsaved typing. If you pause typing it turns green again, meaning your typing has been saved. When you click the dial, you will always end up in the last filespace you used, You can always select which file space you want by holding down an Alt key and typing the number of the desired filespace.

So now, what you can do is type in your filespace. The cursor is at the bottom of the screen and as you type words scroll up. When you are finished typing, wait for the border line to change from red to green to be sure everything was saved and click the dial again. Your keyboard is once more in computer keyboard mode and you can return to what you were doing before.

Fast, efficient transition as needed. One click, writerDeck mode. One click, computer keyboard mode. Instant. Fast. Always ready to type.

### Scenario 2: Using the writerDeck Editor and the Menu on the Rev 4

Lets look at the editor and its capabilities, as well as the menu and what functions it provides. Given a 160 x 80 pixel screen, the editor provides only simple functions. You can type, of course. Typing is always at the bottom of the screen with what you have written scrolling up (appropriately, a typewriter metaphor). The font is quite readable at a size that allows 17 columns and 5 rows to appear on the screen.

Navigation, delete, and backspace are your main editing tools. That is, you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor up or down one line, or left and right one character, as expected. HOME and END move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line you are on and PgUp and PgDn act as screen up and screen down. So you can navigate to review text, delete and retype if you want to edit. There is no spell check, no copy or cut and paste. This is a fine digital typewriter for drafting, but it is not intended for extensive editing (but also doesn't stop you from doing so if you insist).

Coming back to the small screen - we think you'll be surprised. It really helps you focus. There is nothing else you can do. The font is clear and readable, the mechanical keyboard is excellent. It pulls you in. The analogy is to watching a movie on your 6 inch cell phone. If the screen quality is good, it doesn't matter that it is a "small" screen compared to watching it on a large 4K TV. Once you get pulled in, your attention immerses you in the movie.

When you have finished your writing session, you could immediately return to your computer with a quick tap of the knob, as in scenario 1. But there are also a number of things you can do if you invoke the menu. To get to the menu hold (don't tap) the dial until the menu appears. Then release the dial.


### Scenario 3: Using the writerDeck away from the computer in stand alone mode

This is where the batteries come in. For both of the above scenarios the batteries aren't involved because the keyboard is getting its power from the USB connection to your computer. However, this keyboard has a compact footprint and could be easily taken with you somewhere and you could use it for drafting or journaling away from your computer.

The Rev 4 uses three *rechargeable* AAA Ni-MH batteries. Do not use non-rechargeable AAA batteries. They are placed in the Rev 4 by removing the four Torx T10H screws around the power switch and then easing the power switch panel out. The battery holder is on the bottom, set a little back. Place the batteries in the holders (the bottom of the batteries are always against the spring), Then replace the panel and screws, It is a good idea to have already charged the batteries externally before installing as they may otherwise take a while to charge.

When the Rev 4 is disconnected from a computer, with batteries, the power switch acts as would expect. On (1) provides power. Off (0) shuts the Rev 4 down. Connected to the computer, with batteries installed, on charges the batteries, off discontinues charging the batteries. Connected to the computer, the Rev 4 itself always has power.

So now, with batteries, you can take this keyboard with you anywhere, turn it on and start writing. If it doesn't come on with an open filespace, click the dial once and you are ready to go. 

In general, you can focus on writing and take care of everything else when you return to your computer. If the batteries are charged, you should get many hours of anxiety-free typing (at least 10-15 hours).

```
Since your work is constantly being saved, 
you will not lose writing if the batteries fully discharge.
```


## Menu, explained

The menu has the following items. You select the one you want and hit Enter or Return.

* ***Keyboard***
* ***writerDeck***
* ***Drive Mode***
* ***Send Text***
* ***Info Text***
* ***Brightness***
* ***Color BG***
* ***Color Font***
* ***FW Update***
* ***Delete Text***
* ***Exit***


### Keyboard 

Exits the menu and puts you in computer keyboard mode.

### writerDeck

Exits the menu and puts you in writerDeck mode viewing the filespace you were last working in.

### Drive Mode

This option makes the Rev 4's internal storage appear to your computer as an external USB drive (it will pop up a window on your computer with the contents of the Rev 4's storage). 

```
Windows may complain about something not being right and you should scan it. 
Perform the scan. It will fix some technical errors on the file system. 
```

Just wait another moment and a File Explorer window will open showing the files on your Rev 4's internal storage. You can now perform any operation that requires only a mouse.

```
remember, the keyboard doesn't work on the computer while in the menu.
``` 

So you can copy and paste a file to somewhere on your computer or you can open a Filespace file and select, copy and paste the text into a program on your computer (you'll see below that there is another way to do this). When you are done using Drive Mode, Esc returns to the menu.


### Send Text 

This sends the text of the last filespace you were working in to an app window on your computer. This is very much like the Send function on the Alphasmart devices. Make sure you have the app on your computer open and ready to have text added to a file. Then select "Send Text" and hit Enter. The text will be typed into the window on your computer, one letter at a time, but quite rapidly. Do not change to another window until it is done. The text types into whatever window is in focus. When finished, you will return to wherever you were working when you came to the menu - the writerDeck or the computer.

You can press any key to stop in the middle.


### Info Text

Provides stats on the currently selected filespace. Esc returns to the menu.


### Brightness

Allows you to adjust the screen brightness using the dial, Hit Enter or click the dial to return to the menu.


### Color BG

This allows you to change the background color for the writerDeck. Select the color using either the arrow keys or the dial, and hit Enter. Press Esc to exit.

### Color Font

Allows you to change the color of the font used in the writerDeck. Select the color using either the arrow keys or the dial, and hit Enter. Press Esc to exit.


### FW Update 

This is how you update the firmware. First download the firmware for the Rev 4 to your computer. You will find the firmware updates here:

https://github.com/unkyulee/micro-journal/releases

Store the file on your computer in some location that is easy to find. You can even copy it to the computer's clipboard so you are already to go. Go to the menu and select FW Update, It will open a File Explorer window on your computer with an internal partition of your Rev 4, This is not the same as Drive Mode. Drive Mode does not have access to this partition and this mode doesn't have access to the normal storage partition. Paste the firmware update file you previously copied to Rev 4. When the copy is complete, the file manager window will change to the default file manager window as the Rev 4 breaks contact and does the update and exits.




### Delete Text 

This clears all the text in the currently active filespace.



### Exit

Does what hitting Esc in the menu does - takes you to whatever keyboard mode you were last in, either computer keyboard or writerDeck.


In summary, there are several kinds of things on this menu. Settings that you will adjust and maybe not need again. Utilities you will use regularly like Drive Mode, Send Text and Info Text. And then the Firmware Update. All are handy capabilities and settings to make sure you have a good experience with the writerDeck screen and can get your text easily and safely over to your computer.



## Modifying the Rev 4's Key Maps

The Key Maps, or keyboard layout, determines what output is obtained when a key or combination of keys are pressed or held. The most obvious key map is what is printed on your keyboard key caps. But you can change some of those assignments and The Rev 4 provides additional layers so you can have access to even more kinds of keys. In fact, there are two different keyboard maps for the Rev 4: the Key Map for Computer Keyboard Mode and the writerDeck Mode.

The key maps are determined by special text files with the extension of .json (JavaScript Object Notation). It is a way of representing structured data to the computer, in this case Key Maps. This walkthrough assumes no technical understanding of json files. But this walkthrough will show you how to read and modify the json Key Maps.

You will first be walked through the Key Maps and how to modify them. Then you will be shown how to load your modification onto the Rev 4 after making them in a text editor on your computer.

### Computer Keyboard Key Map

Here is the default Computer Keyboard mode Key Map. 

```json
{
  "main": [
    "ESC", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "\b", "DELETE",
    "\t", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PAGE_UP",
    "MACRO_0", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "'", "\\", "PAGE_DOWN",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
    "LEFT_CTRL", "LEFT_GUI", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
    0
  ],

  "alt": [
    "ESC", "F1", "F2", "F3", "F4", "F5", "F6", "F7", "F8", "F9", "F0", "F11", "F12", "\b", "DELETE",
    "\t", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PRINT_SCREEN",
    "MACRO_1", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "'", "\\", "PAGE_DOWN",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
    "LEFT_CTRL", "LEFT_GUI", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
    0
  ],

  "MACRO_0": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_5, KP_1, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_1": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_3, KP_3, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT"
}
```

You can copy text above and paste it into a file to manipulate it with your text editor. The file has to be named **keyboard_usb.json**

There are two layers to this key map. One is labeled "main." That is the top level key assignments, usually reflected in whatever is printed on your key caps, but you can make some modifications.

The second layer is called "alt" for Alternative Keyboard. It allows you to have a whole second layer of assignable keys.

Below the two Keyboard layers are two Macro definitions. Macros allow multiple keystrokes to be assigned to one key. These are most useful for creating Numpad sequences when there is no Numpad. There are many useful ASCII characters writers use that can normally be produces by holding Alt and typing out a 4 digit number sequence on the Number keypad. These Macros allow you to do that because the json definitions include Key Pad outputs.

Naming convention for each keys are coming the source code linked below:
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Keyboard/blob/master/src/Keyboard.h

#### The main layer

```json
"main": [
  "ESC", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "\b", "DELETE",
  "\t", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PAGE_UP",
  "MACRO_0", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "'", "\\", "PAGE_DOWN",
  "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
  "LEFT_CTRL", "LEFT_GUI", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
  0
]
```

With one exception, this should pretty much correspond to what is printed on your default keycaps and they are just typed in, key by key, in between quotes. But some keys can't be just typed in by pressing the key. So "\\b" is Backspace, "\\n" is Enter, "\\t" is TAB and "\\\\" is single Back Slash. Other keys require typing in special Words, like "LEFT_SHIFT" and "UP_ARROW"

The one exception to matching the key caps is the Caps Lock key. You can, of course, have Caps Lock by typing in "CAPS_LOCK", but the default here is to assign the Macro for Em Dash to it. If you look at Macro_0 , it is the equivalent of holding the left Alt key while typing 0151 on the nonexistent number pad.

There is also a "LAYER" key. This is the key that is held down in order to get the alternative keyboard Key Map.

You will notice there is no shift layer exposed in this Json file. You can't make modifications to this layer. However, you will get the expected output to shift. Symbols on the number keys, Capital letters and the shift layer punctuation.


#### The alt layer

```json
"alt": [
  "ESC", "F1", "F2", "F3", "F4", "F5", "F6", "F7", "F8", "F9", "F0", "F11", "F12", "\b", "DELETE",
  "\t", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PRINT_SCREEN",
  "MACRO_1", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "'", "\\", "PAGE_DOWN",
  "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
  "LEFT_CTRL", "LEFT_GUI", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
  0
]
```

This gives you an additional layer for your computer keyboard to include some of the keys the computer is missing. You access this Key Map by holding down the Layer key. Don't feel compelled to change every key. You will see there are a lot of keys in this Key Map that haven't been changed from the main layer. 

The main change is that the F-keys are obtained by holding down the layer key and using the number keys. Importantly, Print Screen is assigned to Page Up on the alt layer. Also, the Macro assigned to Caps Lock is different, this one typing an ellipse. Simply, if you need a key that you don't have on the main and main+shift maps, and you know how to represent that key, add it to this layer. 

Make sure, when making changes, you pay attention to the syntax of the data structure - the commas, quotes, that numbers identifying a key don't have quotes, etc. And, ALWAYS, make a backup of your currently working json file before making and testing changes!

Naming convention for each keys are coming the source code linked:
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Keyboard/blob/master/src/Keyboard.h

You can validate JSON format from a web site:
https://jsonlint.com/



### writerDeck Mode Key Map

It shouldn't be surprising that the writerDeck mode has a different Key Map. Writing on the small screen has different priorities. Plus, there are no Macros for the keyboard in writerDeck mode. 

```json
{
  "main": [
    "ESC", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
    " ", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PGUP",
    0, "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "\"", "\\", "PGDN",
    "SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
    "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
    "MENU"
  ],

  "main-shift": [
    "ESC", "!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
    " ", "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "{", "}", "\n", "PGUP",
    0, "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ":", "'", "|", "PGDN",
    "SHIFT", "~", "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", "<", ">", "?", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
    "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
    "MENU"
  ],

  "alt": [
    "ESC", "FILE1", "FILE2", "FILE3", "FILE4", "FILE5", "FILE6", "FILE7", "FILE8", "FILE9", "FILE0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
    " ", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PGUP",
    0, "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "\"", "\\", "PGDN",
    "SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
    "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
    "MENU"
  ],

  "alt-shift": [
    "ESC", "FILE1", "FILE2", "FILE3", "FILE4", "FILE5", "FILE6", "FILE7", "FILE8", "FILE9", "FILE0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
    " ", "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "{", "}", "\n", "PGUP",
    0, "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ":", "'", "|", "PGDN",
    "SHIFT", "~", "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", "<", ">", "?", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
    "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
    "MENU"
  ]
}
```

You can copy it from the text above and paste it into a file to manipulate it with your text editor. The file has to be named **keyboard.json**

There are four layers to this Key Map, but really it isn't as complex as it might first appear. It is still the main Key Map and the alt Key Map. It is just that both have explicit shift layers. By and large, you will make most of your changes probably to the alt layer, just like Computer Keyboard mode, for keys that don't fit on the main or main-shift layers. Using the alt-shift layer means having to hold down both Alt and Shift to make your key stroke, which will always be more awkward than holding just Alt or just Shift. You can use that layer if you need to, but you probably won't.

There is one bit of potential terminological confusion here. For the "alt Key Map layers, "alt" is short for "alternative." But to activate the Key Map for those layers, you use the Alt key (I believe here Alt is short for Alternate, not that it matters). So to help sorting out whether a reference is to the Key Map layer or the computer key, this document will use "alt" (all lower case) for the Key Map and "Alt" (capitalized) for the computer key.



#### The main and main-shift layers

```json
"main": [
  "ESC", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
  " ", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PGUP",
  0, "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "\"", "\\", "PGDN",
  "SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
  "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
  "MENU"
],

"main-shift": [
  "ESC", "!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
  " ", "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "{", "}", "\n", "PGUP",
  0, "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ":", "'", "|", "PGDN",
  "SHIFT", "~", "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", "<", ">", "?", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
  "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
  "MENU"
]
```

These are both typical for a QWERTY keyboard with few surprises. The TAB key has been disabled by assigning it as a second space bar. TAB would be meaningless on such a small screen. CAPS LOCK has been disabled by simply assigning it the number 0. Finally, as this editing software has no use for Ctrl, Win, or Fn keys, they have all been assigned to be Alt keys, which acts as the layer key, to switch to the alt Key Map layers. You will notice at the bottom a single key label in it's own row called "MENU." That will take you to the menu and it is assigned to the dial hold.

You will notice some slight differences in key names for those that have names rather than just being typed directly. For instance here Delete is "DEL" rather than "DELETE."


#### The alt and alt-shift layers

```json
"alt": [
  "ESC", "FILE1", "FILE2", "FILE3", "FILE4", "FILE5", "FILE6", "FILE7", "FILE8", "FILE9", "FILE0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
  " ", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PGUP",
  0, "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "\"", "\\", "PGDN",
  "SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
  "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
  "MENU"
],

"alt-shift": [
  "ESC", "FILE1", "FILE2", "FILE3", "FILE4", "FILE5", "FILE6", "FILE7", "FILE8", "FILE9", "FILE0", "-", "=", "BACKSPACE", "DEL",
  " ", "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "{", "}", "\n", "PGUP",
  0, "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ":", "'", "|", "PGDN",
  "SHIFT", "~", "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", "<", ">", "?", "SHIFT", "UP", "END",
  "ALT", "ALT", "ALT", " ", "ALT", "ALT", "HOME", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT",
  "MENU"
]
```


Not much has changed here in the default layout. The main thing here is that holding the Alt key and typing a number key will instantly change which filespace you are in. If you need any special symbols or characters, I would assign them in the alt layer if possible so you don't have to hold down two keys and press a third. And while you may not need that many Alt keys, if you don't have something to replace them with, there is certainly no harm in having that many. It is recommended you have at least 2, one on the left side, one on the right as it makes it easier to hold down Alt on one side of the key board and press the key on the opposite side of the keyboard.

One last thing. You create these json files in a text editor on your computer. When you are ready to copy the file to The Rev 4 for updating, use Drive Mode and copy the file to the Rev 4 in Drive Mode. Then hit Esc to return to the menu. You need to power off the Rev 4 and power it back on again to be sure it has read the new file. That just involves disconnecting the USB cable and reconnecting it again.



## Sample Modified Key Maps

So finally, here is a sample set of Key Maps just to give you an idea of what kinds of modifications you can make. I (Hook) developed this to satisfy my own quirks, but it mostly involves a few variations on what Un Kyu Lee has in his default Key Maps.

### Sample Computer Keyboard Key Map


```json
{
  "main": [
    "ESC", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "\b", "DELETE",
    "\t", "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PAGE_UP",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "'", "\\", "PAGE_DOWN",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
    "LEFT_CTRL", "LAYER", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
    0
  ],

  "alt": [
    "ESC", "F1", "F2", "F3", "F4", "F5", "F6", "F7", "F8", "F9", "F10", "F11", "F12", "\b", "DELETE",
    "MACRO_0", "q", "w", "MACRO_5", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p", "[", "]", "\n", "PRINT_SCREEN",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", ";", "MACRO_3", "MACRO_4", "PAGE_DOWN",
    "LEFT_SHIFT", "`", "z", "x", "MACRO_2", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", "MACRO_1", "/", "LEFT_SHIFT", "UP_ARROW", "END",
    "LEFT_CTRL", "LAYER", "LEFT_ALT", " ", "RIGHT_ALT", "LAYER", "HOME", "LEFT_ARROW", "DOWN_ARROW", "RIGHT_ARROW",
    0
  ],

  "MACRO_0": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_5, KP_1, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_1": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_3, KP_3, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_2": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_6, KP_9, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_3": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_4, KP_7, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_4": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_1, KP_4, KP_8, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT",
  "MACRO_5": "!PRESS_LEFT_ALT, KP_0, KP_2, KP_3, KP_3, !RELEASE_LEFT_ALT"
}
```

A few things about the changes here from the default. Notice that there are two Left Shift keys, one being the Caps Lock key. I (Hook) am kind of a clumsy typist. I have often disabled Caps Lock because I tended to hit Caps Lock when I was aiming for shift and would end up yelling at my readers for a couple of lines before I noticed. It's even easier to make that mistake when the Caps Lock key is larger than shift. So, rather than just disabling the Caps Lock key, why not also make it a shift key so that when I hit it by mistake, I still get what I want?

I also created 2 "Layer" keys, one on the right side and one on the left. This is so I can choose which layer key to use to invoke the alt Key Map layer depending on what side of the keyboard the key I need is.

Finally, most of the rest of the changes are my placements of the six Macros I created. They give me  -  (em dash), é (accented e), © (copyright), " (open smartquote), " (close smartquote), and ... (ellipse). I wanted to put them on keys that would help me remember them unless or until I create a custom key cap set. So em dash is Layer+Tab, accented e is Layer+e, copyright is Layer+c, smart open quotes is Layer+single quote and smart close quote is Layer+backslash (just because it is the key next to single quote) and ellipse is Layer+period. These are the 6 Alt-Numpad special characters I use the most.

    "MENU"

}
```

Given the limitations of the Rev 4 editor, there aren't a lot of changes. However, it's useful to have the same 6 special characters here as with the Computer Keyboard mode. I don't have Macros, but I can assign them by typing in the DEC values of the keys. What is wonderful is that I could assign them to exactly the same keys as I did with the computer keyboard. Consistency in Key Maps in both modes is very efficient.

The purpose here was to not tell you how you should set up your Key Maps, but to give an example of what is possible.

## Personalizing GIF Animations

Micro Journal Rev.4 comes with **three GIF animations**. Here’s when they appear and how you can swap them out for your own custom animations.

---

### WriterDeck Start-Up Animation

**Filename:** `wakeup.gif`

When you launch writerDeck mode, the device shows **wakeup.gif**. It signals that writerDeck is starting. Pressing **any key** will skip the animation and jump straight into writing.

---

### WriterDeck Sleep Mode

**Filename:** `sleep.gif`

If writerDeck is left idle for **more than 10 minutes**, the screen will display **sleep.gif**. This hides your text during long breaks. Press **any key** to resume writing.

---

### Computer Keyboard Mode Active Animation

**Filename:** `keyboard.gif`

While in **Keyboard mode**, the screen shows **keyboard.gif**, letting you know you are in standard computer keyboard mode.

---

### How to Create Your Own GIF

Changing the animations is simple: just replace the corresponding GIF file in **Drive Mode**.

You can create GIFs online, for example at [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/).

**Requirements:**

* Width: **160px**
* Height: **80px**
* File size: **≤100 KB**

Once replaced, your new GIF will appear at the right moment automatically.
