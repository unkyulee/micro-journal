## Micro Journal Rev.4.Revamp: 

Rev.4 was designed as a bridge between everyday work and spontaneous writing. At its core, it functions as a regular mechanical keyboard for your computerâ€”but with a flick of a switch, it instantly transforms into a standalone writerDeck. This makes it perfect for those moments when inspiration strikes while you're at your desk. Instead of reaching for a notebook or hunting for another device, you can capture thoughts and ideas right away, without breaking your flow.
