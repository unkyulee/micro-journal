# Micro Journal Rev.4.Revamp Behind Story

Writing a book, or publishing an article, involves a lot of typing. More often, in front of a computer. Editing. Fixing typo. Spell checking. Rearranging and refining paragraphs. Also, a bunch of editorial and technical tasks are involved in finishing a workflow. As a result, writing process makes you spend a lot of time in front of a computer. 

Building a keyboard comes up in my mind as a first thing. 

While writing. Screen is showing almost complete paragraph. Sentences are added. Words are typed on the screen. Meanwhile, in my head. A lot of pieces of words flies by. Most of the should be consistent with the current context. Some of words comes out of no where. With smooth vibe. Can't stop pursuing with that golden piece of sentence just thought of. I can't fit it in just now. But for sure, sounds like a great sentence to use it somewhere. Let me see where is my note, where is my pen. Let me write that down. I can use that in other times. It's for right now. But, I would like to keep it for later. Oh crap! What was it? Nevermind, let me go back to what I was writting.  

Life goes on. But, sounds about right, if those thoughts were captured. It could be nothing. It could be worth noting. You never know. 


## Trigger Moment.

My wife. We have decided to add some office space at home. Two desks. Two monitors, computers, ... and keyboards. She asks. Do we have any extra keyboards? 

For more than a year, I have been building a device to write with a keyboard. I didn't have any keyboard that would actually work on a PC. Should I tell her. Just order two keyboards from Amazon. I couldn't say it. It hurts my ego to say it. Searhcing in the deepest corner of the garage. Found an old keyboard. Tossed it to her and ask her to use that. We won't be spending much time at home working anyways. I said it as if it wasn't a big deal.

I could see here thinking but not saying outloud. No keyboard for me? Seriously?

So, the journey begins for rev.4.revamp. Where the computer keyboard comes first than the micro journal. 


## Design Motives.

It's going to be a keyboard that has staggered layout. I can't risk my marriage trying to teach her how to use ortholinear keyboard. She will ask every time, where is the F5 key? Every time. 

It is going to have a display as well. Is the display going to be big? Is the display going to be wide? Is there any dimension that would naturally fit in? 

I want it to make it look like a keyboard. Keyboard is the main character of this story. If the display is outstanding. Keyboard feels like a support character. But if the display is too small. Would it at all be useful for any type of writing activities? 

I am going to create a device that I will find it useful for writing. At least it could be justifiable. I am thinking. Am I trying to catch two birds with one stone? Probably, going to lose both. Doubts were growing.

Decided to sit down and draw a dimensions of the keys, and display on the Fusion 360. Usually, keyboards don't have much space for other elements. It's just keys and enclosures. I could make a cute keyboard design. But, adding more elements like display and also batteries and charging modules. Needed more space. 

More spaces drawn for the extra elements. Less it looked like a keyboard.

What about a writing machine without a screen. Like a keylogger. Maybe some led indicator to indicate the registering activity. Nothing to show the text. No way to see what is written. 

Huh?

Sounded crazy. Although, there has been a post asking for this. Who wants to register their writing with no screens. Slept on this idea for several days. Maybe just showing the indication of the texts are written down. Is good enough? Doens't need to be display too much information. Just show that something is getting written down. 

This could be a good reason to just keep on writing. As you can't see what has been written behind. Effort to be consistent with the context is eliminated. This sounds like a good direction. 


## Design Philosophy.

So. Hmm.... Writing is difficult. Mostly because there is a fear that maybe what I write isn't right. So, you tend to check the flow of the context and try to find a word that fits. Read back what has been written. Again, and again. Keep refining the words, sentence, paragraphs. To keep it consistent. To make it better.

Eventually, to tell a story. To convey a message. Texts needs to be correct and consistent. This is of course, a necessary steps to writing. Although, it's could end up in a blank chapter 1. for months. Because, it's so scary to take that first step. Plenty of ideas are there. Waiting to be expressed. But just that first word is going to decide everything. So, it has to be the right one. A better one. A lot of pressure.

What I am focusing in the micro journal is to capture the flowing ideas. Minimizing the resistent to correct. Just write down your thoughts. It doesn't need to be correct. It doesn't have to make sense. Focus on capturing your thoughts and words. Right now just tell me what you think. Tell me what you feel. Write like a journal. Only you would be reading it. No one else. Do you still need to worry about being correct? 

Just like you would take a number two. Do you look back at them? You only want to them to be out. Aren't you?


## How Want It to Look.

Somewhere in a doom scrolling session. I have remembered to see this Sony MSX image. I am not sure if this is a real product or a concept art. 

It struck me so hard. I want to be able to bring out the vibe, that works in a real life. 

(I am going to continue writing this story... for now going to sleep.)
