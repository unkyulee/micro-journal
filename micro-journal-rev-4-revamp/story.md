# Micro Journal Rev.4.Revamp — Behind the Story

Writing a book, or publishing an article, involves a lot of typing. Usually in front of a computer. There's editing, fixing typos, checking spelling, rearranging and refining paragraphs. On top of that, countless editorial and technical tasks fill the workflow. All of this means the writing process keeps you sitting in front of a screen for hours.

So of course, the first thing that came to my mind was: *build a keyboard.*

While writing, the screen shows nearly finished paragraphs. Sentences grow, words appear. But in my head, fragments of other thoughts are flying by. Some belong to the context, some come from nowhere with a smooth vibe. I can't stop chasing that golden sentence I just thought of. It doesn't fit right now, but it feels too good to lose. *Where's my notebook? Where's my pen?* Let me write this down for later.

Oh crap... what was it? Gone. Back to the draft.

Life goes on. But it always feels like those fleeting thoughts are worth capturing. Maybe they're nothing. Maybe they're worth noting. You never know.

## The Trigger Moment

My wife and I decided to set up office space at home: two desks, two monitors, two computers... and keyboards. She asked, "Do we have any extra keyboards?"

For over a year, I'd been building devices for writing. Not a single keyboard that could just plug into a PC. Should I tell her to order two from Amazon? I couldn't bring myself to say it. My pride wouldn't allow it. Instead, I dug through the garage, found an old keyboard, tossed it to her, and said, "Use this. We won't be working from home that much anyway."

I could see her thinking, without saying it out loud: *No keyboard for me? Seriously?*

That moment sparked **Rev.4.Revamp** where the idea of a proper computer keyboard finally came before the Micro Journal.

## Design Motives

This one had to be a staggered layout. I wasn't about to risk my marriage trying to explain ortholinear. She'd ask every time: *“Where's the F5 key?”*

It also needed a display. But how big? How wide? What proportions would feel natural?

The keyboard had to remain the star of the show. If the display stood out too much, the keyboard would become just a supporting character. Too small, and the display would be useless for writing.

I wanted something I would personally find useful for writing. Enough to justify the effort. Still, doubts crept in. Was I trying to catch two birds with one stone, and risk losing both?

I sat down in Fusion 360, sketching key dimensions and testing how a display might fit. Normally keyboards are just keys and enclosure. Adding extra elements, a display, batteries, charging modules, required more space.

But the more space I added, the less it looked like a keyboard.

At one point I thought: what if it had *no screen at all*? A writing machine, like a keylogger? Maybe just an LED to confirm input, with no way to see the text. Crazy, right? But someone online had actually asked for that. Makes me wonder. What is the essence of that desire?

I slept on the idea. Maybe just a minimal indicator is enough. You don't *need* to see every word. In fact, it might encourage better writing. No chance to endlessly reread and edit. Just keep writing.

That thought stuck with me.

## Design Philosophy

Writing is hard, mostly because of fear. Fear that what you're writing isn't good enough. Fear that the first word will set the wrong tone. So you reread, refine, rearrange. Again and again. Until "Chapter 1" sits blank for months.

But Micro Journal is about capturing flowing ideas. Not perfect texts. It's about lowering the resistance to just *write*. Thoughts don't need to be correct. They don't need to make sense. Just capture them. Like a journal only you will ever read.

If no one else will see it, do you still need to be correct?

It's a bit like going to the bathroom. You don't look back. You just want it out. Writing can be the same.

## How I Want It to Look

Somewhere in a doomscrolling session I stumbled across this Sony MSX image. I'm not sure if it was ever a real product or just concept art.

But it struck me hard. That's the vibe I want to bring into reality.
