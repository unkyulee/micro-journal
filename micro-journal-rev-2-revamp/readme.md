## Micro Journal Rev.2.ReVamp: Mother of Twins 

Bringing Revision 2 back to life with an upgraded, foldable enclosure that offers extra protection against the relentless curiosity of the twin boys. Powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, it features a 48-key mini keyboard and side knobs for easy scrolling. A modern take on the classic typewriter.

A mother of twins (five in total) challenged me to create a foldable design, which is far more complex than other designs due to its many moving parts. The goal was to ensure durability while keeping the mechanism as simple as possible. It was quite a challenge, but I'm pleased with the outcome. Still, I wonder whether the design reflects my intention and skill or if it's simply a happy accident that happened to turn out well.
