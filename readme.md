# Micro Journal

**Micro Journal** is an open-source DIY project that reimagines the joy of focused writing through a personal **writerDeck**. A writerDeck is a modern take on the typewriter. A simple, distraction-free device made for writing, without the noise of notifications, apps, or endless browser tabs. It brings back the purity of just you and your words, while quietly adding the convenience of digital storage and portability.

With Micro Journal, I'm exploring how to build such a device from the ground up—experimenting with hardware, design, and features across different revisions. Each iteration aims to refine the experience, from adding battery power and portability to improving usability and syncing. It's both a tool for writing and a journey in open-source DIY design.


## Project Revisions

* Rev.1 – *a place holder for future projects*

* **[Rev.2](/micro-journal-rev-2-revamp/readme.md)** – A Raspberry Pi–based setup with a wide display and mechanical keyboard. This version aimed to combine a focused writing experience with the editing power of a full computer, offering both simplicity and flexibility.

* Rev.3 – *a place holder for future projects*

* **[Rev.4](/micro-journal-rev-4-revamp/readme.md)** – A hybrid mechanical keyboard that doubles as a regular computer keyboard, but can instantly transition into a writing device with a built-in display. Designed for seamless use at the desk, this version emphasized quick access to writing without switching setups.

* **[Rev.5](/micro-journal-rev-5-esp32-usbhost/readme.md)** – An ESP32-powered screen-only device where you can plug in your own keyboard. This revision focused on flexibility, letting users pair the device with their favorite mechanical keyboards while keeping the writing deck lightweight and minimal.

* **[Rev.6](/micro-journal-rev-6-one-piece/readme.md)** – An ESP32-based all-in-one unit combining both screen and keyboard. Portable and self-contained, this version brought the writerDeck concept closer to a dedicated, ready-to-use device with a clean design.

* **[Rev.7](/micro-journal-rev-2-revamp/readme.md)** – An ESP32-based an e-ink writing device with a built-in keyboard. Optimized for comfort, it offers an easy-on-the-eyes experience and works beautifully in bright environments thanks to its paper-like e-ink display.
