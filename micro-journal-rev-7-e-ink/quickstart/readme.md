**Check the battery polarity carefully.** The battery holder has markings for positive (+) and negative (-) polarity. The spring side of the holder is the negative (-) side. Incorrect polarity can cause irreversible damage to the device.

**Install the 18650 battery,** ensuring you follow the correct polarity as shown on the battery holder.

**Double-check the installation** to ensure the battery is properly seated and the polarity is correct. Having a tape sticked around the battery as shown in the picture, can help to easily and swiftly pull out the battery in case of any issues.

After installing the battery make sure that no cable is clipped on to the edge while closing the lid. 


### Important Notes:

**Check the battery polarity carefully.** The battery holder has markings for positive (+) and negative (-) polarity. The spring side of the holder is the negative (-) side. Incorrect polarity can cause irreversible damage to the device.

**Ensure the battery is fully charged** before use. LiPo batteries are not shipped fully charged. After installing the battery, connect the device to the charging port and leave it charging for at least 4 hours before first use.

**Battery installation safety:** Improper handling or installation can cause a fire. Be cautious and avoid over-tightening the screws. If the case doesnâ€™t close easily, check that no cables are pinched, as this could lead to short circuits, damage, or fire hazards.


#### Step 2. Charging the battery


**USB-C cable:** Please, make sure that when you plug in the charger you see the red or green light coming out from the enclosure. When you don't see any lights means that it is not charging. This means, charger is not compatible. Please, use USB-A to C cable. Most likely, USB-C to C cable will not be able to charge the device. Modern USB-C chargers that has PD (Power Delivery) will not work. Use older phone charger which most likely supplies USB-A to C type of cables.
