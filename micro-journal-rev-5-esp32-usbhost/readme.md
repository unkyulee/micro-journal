## Micro Journal Rev.5: A Personal Journey

In this iteration, I delved into exploring the potential of utilizing the USB port to enable connectivity with a wide range of mechanical keyboards. This enhancement offers the flexibility for users to employ their preferred keyboard for writing purposes, thereby enhancing the personalized experience and comfort level during usage.

So, I proceeded to design an enclosure to sit next to the keyboard, utilizing the ESP32-S3, which boasts native USB host features. I then updated the code, and voilà! The new version was born.

There are some stories detailing the exploration of USB HOST features in ESP32 and ESP32-S3. Check out the link above for the full narrative and build guides.
